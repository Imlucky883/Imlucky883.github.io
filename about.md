I work in <strong>platform and infrastructure engineering</strong>. Most of my day revolves around _Linux systems_, _Kubernetes_, _cloud platforms_, and figuring out why something that should work doesn’t.

Instead of keeping scattered notes across tools and losing context over time, this blog acts as a long-term memory. 

This blog reflects how I think: questioning defaults, challenging assumptions, and digging until things make sense at a systems level.

I use this space to document what I’m learning—mainly around Linux, networking, Kubernetes, cloud infrastructure, security, and how systems actually work under the hood. Most posts are written while I’m in the middle of figuring something out, not after I’ve “mastered” it.

If you’re looking for polished, beginner-friendly guides, this probably isn’t for you.
If you’re someone who likes understanding why things behave the way they do, you’ll feel at home here.
