## The Genesis

**Context & Motivation**  
Fyodor Dostoevsky wrote Crime and Punishment (published 1866) during a period of immense personal desperation. Following his release from a decade of exile and hard labor in Siberia, he was plagued by gambling debts and the obligation to support his deceased brother’s family. He wrote the novel in a state of starvation, much like his protagonist, literally rushing to finish chapters to pay his creditors.

**The Critique of "Rational Egoism"**  
Dostoevsky wrote this book as a violent reaction against the wave of Western European ideas flooding Russia in the 1860s—specifically **Nihilism** and **Utilitarianism**.

- **The Radical Youth:** The younger generation was rejecting traditional morality and religion in favor of pure logic and science.
    
- **The Calculus of Death:** Dostoevsky was horrified by the utilitarian idea that one could commit a "useful crime"—killing a worthless person to use their wealth for the greater good of humanity. He wrote this book to test that theory in a laboratory of the human soul, proving that human nature and conscience cannot be suppressed by simple arithmetic.

**Why Read This Today?**  
While the setting is 19th-century St. Petersburg, the central conflict is timeless. In a modern world dominated by data, efficiency, and the "great man" worship of tech moguls and disruptors, Crime and Punishment forces the reader to ask: Does the end justify the means?

## PART 1
### Chapter I
![[Crime and Punishment-1.png | 250]]

On an exceptionally hot evening in early July, Raskolnikov leaves his tiny garret—a low-ceilinged room under the roof that feels like a cupboard or a coffin. He creeps down the stairs to avoid his landlady, to whom he owes money, and steps out into the stifling St. Petersburg air. The streets are choked with dust, lime, scaffolding, and the nauseating stench of the dram-shops. He is dressed in rags, specifically wearing a tall, battered, round hat from Zimmerman’s that looks ridiculous and draws attention. He walks slowly, counting his steps, as he knows the exact distance to his destination: 730 steps.

He arrives at a massive house on the canal, bypasses the porter, and climbs the dark, narrow back staircase. He rings the bell of an old woman’s flat; it makes a faint, tinny sound. The door opens a crack, revealing the suspicious, glittering little eyes of Alyona Ivanovna. He pushes his way in. The flat is small but spotlessly clean, with yellow wallpaper and geraniums illuminated by the setting sun. He pawns an old silver watch with a globe engraved on the back. The old woman is tiny, sharp-nosed, and wears a flannel rag around her neck and a mangy fur cape; her hair is greased and ratty. She treats him with disdain, offering a pittance. As he leaves, Raskolnikov memorizes that she keeps her keys in her right pocket and promises to return soon with a silver cigarette case.

**Raskolnikov’s Mindset:**  
He is in a state of hypochondriacal tension and oscillation. He refers to his murder plan only as "That" or "The Project," terrified of naming it. He feels a deep, physical revulsion for his surroundings and himself. After leaving the pawnbroker, the reality of his "project" hits him with such disgust that he feels nauseous. He thinks, "Can I possibly... no, it's loathsome!" He is starving and his mind is spinning, craving alcohol or food to numb the sudden horror of his own thoughts.

---
### Chapter II

Tormented by thirst and his own thoughts, Raskolnikov descends into a dark, sticky basement tavern. It is here he encounters **Semyon Zaharovitch Marmeladov**, a retired official with a bloated, green-tinged face and clothes that are literally falling off him (buttons missing, hay stuck to his coat). Marmeladov, drunk and articulate, latches onto Raskolnikov. Amidst the jeers of the tavern staff, he delivers a tragic monologue about his life: how he drank away his family’s money, stole his wife’s stockings to buy liquor, and how his daughter, Sonia, was forced to accept a "yellow ticket" (prostitution license) to feed her starving siblings.

![[Crime and Punishment-2.png | 220]]

Raskolnikov assists the drunk man home to a chaotic, smoke-filled walk-through room. He meets Katerina Ivanovna, Marmeladov's wife, who is pacing the floor, coughing blood, and exhausted. She is of noble birth and is furious at her husband’s return, grabbing him by the hair and dragging him while he screams that this is a "consolation" to him. The scene is a nightmare of poverty—crying children in rags and a dying woman. Raskolnikov leaves quietly, placing his last few coppers on the windowsill for them, though he immediately regrets the charity once outside.

**Raskolnikov’s Mindset:**  
He begins the chapter seeking escape from his own "monomania" and finds a grim fascination in Marmeladov’s misery. The story validates his growing nihilism—that poverty crushes the soul and leaves a man with "nowhere to turn." Upon leaving the money, a wave of cold cynicism washes over him. He thinks, "Man grows used to everything, the scoundrel!" but then immediately challenges his own thought: "But what if I am wrong, and man is not a scoundrel?"

---

### Chapter III

Raskolnikov wakes the next morning in his tattered sofa, feeling bilious and irritable. Nastasya, the cook and servant, brings him leftover cabbage soup and tea, but warns him that the landlady wants to evict him and report him to the police for his debts. She then hands him a letter from his mother, Pulcheria. Raskolnikov stares at the handwriting, kisses the envelope, and sends Nastasya away so he can read it in private.

The letter is long and detailed. It reveals that his sister, Dounia, suffered a great humiliation while working as a governess for the Svidrigaïlov family—Mr. Svidrigaïlov tried to seduce her, and his wife Marfa Petrovna ruined Dounia's reputation before discovering the truth and restoring it. The critical news is that Dounia has agreed to marry Pyotr Petrovitch Luzhin, a wealthy, 45-year-old government official who is morose and vain. Luzhin explicitly stated he wanted a poor wife so she would be indebted to him. The family is coming to St. Petersburg, hoping Luzhin will hire Raskolnikov as a secretary.

**Raskolnikov’s Mindset:**  
The letter acts as a violent catalyst. He immediately decodes the subtext: Dounia is selling herself to Luzhin, just as Sonia sold herself, to save Raskolnikov and their mother from poverty. He feels suffocated by their sacrifice ("I won't have it!"). His mind races with a mix of fury, love, and impotence. The abstract "project" (the murder) suddenly begins to solidify from a fantasy into a necessary, tangible solution to save his sister from a lifetime of slavery to Luzhin.

---
### Chapter IV

Tormented by the letter, Raskolnikov wanders aimlessly toward Vassilyevsky Ostrov, talking to himself and debating Dounia's marriage. On a boulevard, he notices a drunk teenage girl (about 15 or 16) staggering with a torn dress; she has clearly been abused and dumped on the street. A fat, well-dressed "dandy" is stalking her, waiting for her to pass out completely so he can take advantage of her.

Raskolnikov flies into a rage. He attacks the dandy, shouting "Hey! You Svidrigaïlov!" and clenches his fists. A policeman intervenes. Raskolnikov explains the situation and gives the policeman his last twenty copecks to get the girl a cab home. However, as he walks away, his mood shifts instantly. He shouts back to the policeman, "Let them be! Let them devour each other alive!" He heads toward the home of his friend Razumihin but decides at the last second not to enter, resolving only to see him after "It" is done.

**Raskolnikov’s Mindset:**  
He is experiencing extreme psychological fragmentation. One moment he is the altruistic savior (protecting the girl), the next he is the cold nihilist (regretting the lost money and deciding that the "percentage" of victims is just a law of nature). He realizes he cannot visit Razumihin (who represents reason and normalcy) until he has crossed the threshold. He feels alienated from humanity, unable to interact with friends until his fate is decided.

---
### Chapter V

Raskolnikov enters a cheap tavern, eats a small pie, and drinks a glass of vodka, which affects him deeply due to his empty stomach. He walks to the Islands (a park area) and falls asleep in the bushes. He has a terrifying nightmare: He is a child of seven in his hometown. He watches a group of drunk peasants try to force an old, weak mare to pull a massive cart. When the horse collapses, the owner, Mikolka, beats it to death with a crowbar while the crowd laughs. The boy Raskolnikov rushes to the dead horse and kisses its bleeding muzzle.

He wakes up sweating and horrified. He walks home through the Hay Market (Sennaya Ploshchad). By sheer chance, he overhears Lizaveta (the pawnbroker's sister) talking to a huckster. He learns the specific detail that seals his fate: Lizaveta will be out of the apartment tomorrow night at 7:00 PM, meaning the old woman will be home alone.

**Raskolnikov’s Mindset:**  
The dream highlights the deep split in his psyche: his subconscious (the child) is horrified by violence and weeps for the victim, while his conscious mind (Mikolka) is driven to strike the fatal blow. Upon waking, he explicitly asks himself, "Can I really take an axe and split her skull?" and decides he cannot. He feels liberated from the "spell." However, hearing the news about 7:00 PM destroys his freedom. He feels like the hem of his coat has been caught in the wheel of a machine—he is now being dragged into the crime by fate.

---
### Chapter VI

The final preparations begin. Raskolnikov sleeps heavily and wakes up late. He constructs a "pledge" out of a piece of wood and a strip of iron, wrapped in paper and tied with string, to distract the old woman. He sews a loop inside his coat to hold the axe. He plans to steal the axe from the kitchen, but when he goes down, the servant Nastasya is there hanging clothes. He panics, almost loses his nerve, but then notices the door to the porter’s lodge is open and the porter is missing. He slips in, steals the axe from under a bench, puts it in the loop, and walks out unseen.

He walks the 730 steps to the crime scene. He feels his heart beating too fast. He enters the building, climbs the stairs, and rings the bell three times. He hears someone inside listening and waiting. He can hear the rustle of a dress against the door.

**Raskolnikov’s Mindset:**  
He moves like an automaton, focused entirely on the mechanical details (the loop, the pledge) to avoid thinking about the enormity of the act. He operates on a "clouded" logic, paranoid that everyone is looking at his hat. He rationalizes that criminals usually get caught because they lose their reason during the crime; he vows to keep his reason intact, but his physical symptoms (trembling, heart palpitations) suggest he is losing control.

---
### Chapter VII

The door opens. Raskolnikov enters. The room is lit by the setting sun. He offers the fake pledge to Alyona Ivanovna. As she turns to the window to untie the knot, he pulls the axe from his coat. He brings the blunt side down on her head twice. She falls. He strikes her again. He frantically searches her pockets for the keys (shaking hands, slipping in the warm blood). He finds the keys and goes to the bedroom, trying to unlock the chest under the bed. He hears footsteps.

The Twist: Lizaveta has returned quietly. She is standing in the middle of the room, staring at her dead sister, paralyzed with fear, not even screaming. Raskolnikov runs at her and kills her with the sharp edge of the axe. He is terrified. He washes the blood from his hands and the axe in a bucket.

The Climax: He prepares to leave, but the door is locked from the inside. Someone knocks. It is Koch and a young student. They realize the door is hooked from the inside (meaning someone is home) and assume someone is hiding. They go down to get the porter. Raskolnikov unlocks the door, slips into an empty flat being painted on the floor below, hides behind a wall while the men run upstairs, and then escapes into the street. He returns the axe to the porter's lodge and collapses on his sofa.

**Raskolnikov’s Mindset:**  
Pure, animalistic terror. The theory of the "Superman" vanishes; he is simply a desperate animal trying not to be trapped. The murder of Lizaveta destroys the "justice" of his crime (killing the louse)—he has now killed an innocent. During the knocking at the door, he loses his focus and almost passes out, only saved by the survival instinct. He ends the chapter in a state of oblivion, his mind shutting down to protect itself.

---
## PART 2 
### Chapter I

Raskolnikov wakes late, long after ten, in a state of feverish stupor. He is panicked to find the door unlocked and the room full of sunlight. Nastasya enters with tea and soup, but she brings terrifying news: he has received a summons to the police station. Raskolnikov is paralyzed with fear, convinced they know about the murder. As he dresses, he makes a horrific discovery—the sock he wore during the crime is stiff with caked blood. He tries to rub it off, but it only smears. He tears off the bloody fringe and pockets it, trembling violently.

He walks into the stifling heat of the street, heading toward the police station. He feels a desire to fall to his knees and confess immediately to end the torment. Upon arriving at the station, he is nearly overwhelmed by the sickening smell of fresh paint in the stairwell. He enters a room full of scribbling clerks and meets the loud, bombastic assistant superintendent, Ilya Petrovitch ("Gunpowder").

To his shock, the summons is not for murder, but for the recovery of a debt he owes his landlady. The relief is so intense it is almost painful. However, while signing a declaration to pay, he overhears the police discussing the murder of the pawnbroker. The physical strain and the mention of the crime cause him to faint dead away. When he wakes, the officers are looking at him with a strange, new suspicion.

**Raskolnikov’s Mindset:**  
He moves from absolute terror to hysterical relief, and then back to paranoia. When he discovers the summons is for debt, he feels a "wild, hysterical joy." But the fainting spell destroys his safety; he realizes his body has betrayed him. He leaves the station feeling that he has marked himself as a suspect in their eyes. He feels a permanent cleavage has occurred between him and humanity.

---
### Chapter II

Raskolnikov rushes home, terrified that the police will search his room while he is out. He remembers that he hid the stolen purse and trinkets in a hole behind the wallpaper. He stuffs his pockets with the jewelry and the purse, grabs his hat, and flees the apartment. He wanders toward the Neva River, intending to throw the loot into the water, but the area is too crowded with people and rafts. He turns away, walking frantically toward the V—— Prospect.

He finds a deserted courtyard surrounded by blank walls and a black, soot-covered shed. Near the gate, he spots a massive, unhewn stone. Straining with all his might, he lifts the stone and dumps the purse and trinkets into the hollow beneath it, then stamps the earth down. The evidence is gone. He laughs nervously, feeling a temporary surge of joy.

He wanders to the apartment of his friend, Razumihin. He enters looking like a wild man—unshaven, ragged, and feverish. Razumihin is shocked by his appearance and offers him work translating texts. Raskolnikov accepts the papers, but moments later, overwhelmed by disgusted apathy, he throws the papers aside and walks out, leaving Razumihin bewildered. He stumbles home, shivering, and collapses into a delirious sleep.

**Raskolnikov’s Mindset:**  
He is driven by a singular, animalistic instinct: hide the evidence. He operates in a fog, barely aware of the streets he walks. After burying the goods, he feels a moment of triumph ("It is all over! No clue!"), but it is hollow. His visit to Razumihin highlights his isolation; he realizes he cannot engage in normal life (work, friendship) because he carries the secret of the murder. He actively severs ties with the human world.

---
### Chapter III

Raskolnikov lies in a high fever for several days, drifting in and out of consciousness. He hallucinates that his landlady is being beaten by the police officer, Ilya Petrovitch, on the stairs—a nightmare so vivid he screams in terror. When he finally wakes up fully, it is morning. Razumihin is there; he has been nursing Raskolnikov through the illness, along with the cook, Nastasya.

Razumihin brings news: a messenger from Raskolnikov's mother has brought money—35 roubles. Razumihin has also taken the liberty of buying Raskolnikov new clothes (a cap, trousers, and boots) to replace his rags, using some of the money. Zossimov, a young, self-important doctor, arrives to check on the patient. Raskolnikov lies silently, turning to the wall, filled with loathing for their kindness.

**Raskolnikov’s Mindset:**  
He is in a state of "moral fatigue." He feels an intense, almost physical hatred for everyone around him, especially those trying to help. Their presence violates his need for total isolation. He is terrified that he might have said something about the murder during his delirium. He listens to every word they say, playing possum, trying to gauge how much they know.

---
### Chapter IV

The room becomes a scene of social gathering. Zossimov and Razumihin sit and chat, unaware that Raskolnikov is intensely listening. They discuss the murder of the pawnbroker. Razumihin criticizes the police investigation, arguing that they are too focused on tangible facts and not enough on psychology.

They discuss a house painter named Mikolka, who has been arrested because he tried to sell earrings belonging to the victim. Razumihin argues passionately that Mikolka is innocent and that the real murderer must have been a calculated, educated man who managed to slip away unnoticed. As they reconstruct the crime scene in conversation, Raskolnikov lies frozen, hearing his own actions analyzed with frightening accuracy.

**Raskolnikov’s Mindset:**  
He is on a razor's edge. Hearing the details of the investigation is torture, yet he is fascinated. He feels a sense of superiority over the police because they are chasing the wrong leads, but also a dread that Razumihin’s sharp intellect is getting too close to the truth (that the murderer hid in the empty apartment).

---
### Chapter V

A stranger enters the room—Pyotr Petrovitch Luzhin, Dounia's fiancé. He is stiff, pompous, and overly groomed, wearing a fresh round hat and lilac-colored gloves. He treats the poverty-stricken room and its occupants with barely concealed disdain. He attempts to impress the young men with trendy "progressive" talk, but Razumihin cuts him down.

Raskolnikov suddenly breaks his silence. He attacks Luzhin, exposing the man’s theory on marriage: that Luzhin wants a poor wife so she will be slavishly grateful to him. Raskolnikov commands Luzhin to leave, shouting, "Or else I shall send you flying downstairs!" Luzhin leaves in a huff, vowing revenge. The exertion drains Raskolnikov, and he demands everyone leave him alone.

**Raskolnikov’s Mindset:**  
He feels a "physical repulsion" for Luzhin. This scene is a release of the pent-up aggression Raskolnikov feels toward the sale of his sister. He is defending Dounia’s honor, but he is also projecting his self-hatred onto Luzhin. By driving Luzhin away, he is trying to sever the cord of "sacrifice" that connects him to his family.

---
### Chapter VI

Determined to end his uncertainty, Raskolnikov dresses in his new clothes and sneaks out of the apartment. He wanders the streets, feeling lightheaded and dizzy. He enters a tavern called the "Crystal Palace" and orders tea. There, he spots Zamyotov, the head police clerk, sitting at a table. Raskolnikov sits with him.

In a scene of terrifying psychological brinksmanship, Raskolnikov mocks Zamyotov. With a shaking lip and glittering eyes, he leans in and whispers, "And what if it was I who killed the old woman and Lizaveta?" He laughs nervously, challenging the clerk. Zamyotov is disturbed but ultimately dismisses Raskolnikov as a crazy, impoverished student. Raskolnikov leaves the tavern and runs into Razumihin on the street, who invites him to a party. Raskolnikov refuses coldly and walks away into the dark.

**Raskolnikov’s Mindset:**  
This is the "moth flying into the flame." He is flirting with destruction. He feels an irresistible urge to tease the police, to see how close he can get to confessing without actually doing it. It is a mix of arrogance ("You can't catch me") and a subconscious desire to be caught. He feels reckless, drunk without wine.

---
### Chapter VII

Raskolnikov wanders to a bridge, contemplating suicide, but turns away. He walks toward the Hay Market and sees a commotion. A man has been trampled by a horse-drawn carriage. Raskolnikov pushes through the crowd and recognizes Marmeladov, the drunkard from Chapter 2. He is covered in blood and unconscious.

Raskolnikov takes charge, shouting for help and paying for the dying man to be carried to his nearby apartment. The scene at the Marmeladovs is chaotic: Katerina Ivanovna is frantic, the children are crying, and the room is filled with curious onlookers. A priest arrives. Marmeladov regains consciousness for a moment, asks forgiveness from his daughter Sonia (who has arrived in her gaudy streetwalker clothes), and dies in her arms.

Raskolnikov, feeling a sudden surge of strength, gives Katerina Ivanovna the 20 roubles (all the money his mother sent him) for the funeral. He leaves, feeling revitalized. As he walks down the stairs, little Polenka (Sonia’s sister) runs after him to thank him. He asks her to pray for him. He goes to Razumihin’s party for a moment, then returns to his own room—only to find his mother and Dounia waiting for him in the dark. He faints at their feet.

**Raskolnikov’s Mindset:**  
A massive shift occurs here. The act of helping the Marmeladovs—a genuine, spontaneous act of charity—breaks his isolation. He feels a sudden influx of life and energy ("Life is real! Haven't I lived just now?"). The "dead" feeling vanishes. He believes he can perhaps live with his crime, that he is strong enough to rise above it. However, the sudden appearance of his mother and sister at the end shatters this temporary peace, dragging him back into the reality of his double life.

---
## PART 3
### Chapter I

Raskolnikov wakes up on the sofa to find the room filled with tension. His mother, Pulcheria, and sister, Dounia, are sitting right beside him, having waited for him to wake. They are weeping, overwhelmed with relief that he is alive, but also terrified by his appearance. Raskolnikov looks at them with a strange, dead expression; he feels an unbearable physical revulsion at their displays of affection. He cannot lift his arms to embrace them. The closeness is suffocating him.

He suddenly lashes out, demanding that they leave. He turns on Dounia, explicitly forbidding her marriage to Luzhin. "I won't accept the sacrifice," he rasps. "It's me or Luzhin." The scene descends into chaos; Pulcheria is distraught, thinking he is delirious again. Razumihin, sensing the danger of the situation, physically ushers the two weeping women out of the room, promising to guard Raskolnikov with his life and bring them a report in the morning.

**Raskolnikov’s Mindset:**  
He is experiencing emotional anesthesia. The love of his family feels like a heavy weight pressing on his chest. He realizes that by loving him, they bind him to humanity—and he has severed that bond with the axe. He feels he cannot be a brother or a son while the crime sits between them. He drives them away to protect himself from the pain of their innocence.

---
### Chapter II

The perspective shifts to Razumihin. He escorts the women to their cheap, dirty hotel rooms (booked by the stingy Luzhin). Razumihin is drunk, hyper-active, and hopelessly infatuated with the tall, proud Dounia. He rants against Luzhin, calling him a scoundrel, and tries to comfort the women.

The next morning, a sober and embarrassed Razumihin visits the women for coffee. He gives a psychological profile of Raskolnikov that is chillingly accurate. He tells them Raskolnikov has two distinct personalities: one is kind and noble, the other is cold, inhumanly callous, and arrogant. "It is as though he were alternating between two characters," Razumihin explains. He warns them that Raskolnikov loves no one and might never love anyone.

**Raskolnikov’s Mindset:**  
(This chapter focuses on Razumihin’s perspective, but it reveals Raskolnikov’s external mask: a cold, closed-off fortress that even his best friend cannot penetrate.)

---
### Chapter III

Raskolnikov has cleaned himself up. He acts calm, almost mechanical, trying to play the role of a dutiful son. He apologizes to his mother and sister for his outburst the previous day, taking Dounia’s hand awkwardly. The air is thick with unspoken tension. Pulcheria is afraid to touch him. Raskolnikov admits he gave all his money to the consumptive widow (Marmeladov’s wife), which shocks his mother, but Dounia defends him.

The conversation turns to Luzhin. Pulcheria shows Raskolnikov a letter from Luzhin. In it, Luzhin complains about Raskolnikov’s rude behavior and demands a meeting with the women on the condition that Raskolnikov is not present. He also slanders Raskolnikov, implying he gave the money to Sonia for "immoral purposes." Dounia, furious at Luzhin’s attempt to control them, decides they will defy the order: Raskolnikov will come to the meeting that evening at 8:00 PM.

**Raskolnikov’s Mindset:**  
He is calculating and cold. He reads Luzhin's letter with a lawyer’s eye, spotting the malicious intent immediately. He feels a grim satisfaction that the confrontation is inevitable. He is no longer acting out of feverish passion but out of a cold desire to destroy Luzhin’s hold on his sister.

---
### Chapter IV

Just as they are discussing the letter, the door opens softly. Sonia enters the room, dressed in her modest street clothes, looking terrified and shy. She has come to invite Raskolnikov to her father’s funeral and the memorial dinner. The social collision is excruciating: the "fallen woman" standing before the noble mother and sister. Raskolnikov introduces her, defiantly breaking social taboos. Pulcheria is stiff and awkward, but Dounia bows to Sonia with genuine respect, understanding her sacrifice.

Sonia flees the room in embarrassment, followed by Raskolnikov. In the hallway, he promises to come to the funeral. He also whispers a strange request: he wants to come to her later. He tells her he will come to see her "for the last time" and that he has "abandoned his family."

**Raskolnikov’s Mindset:**  
He feels a sudden, magnetic pull toward Sonia. He recognizes her as a fellow outcast—someone who has also "stepped over" the line of morality (she through prostitution, he through murder). He feels she is the only one who can understand the darkness he is living in. He is drawn to her not by romance, but by shared damnation.

---
### Chapter V

Raskolnikov and Razumihin go to the police station to see Porfiry Petrovitch, the lead investigator. Raskolnikov wants to reclaim his pawned items (the watch and ring) to maintain the appearance of innocence. The scene in Porfiry’s office is a masterpiece of psychological warfare. Porfiry is a short, round, casual man who giggles constantly, but his eyes are sharp.

They discuss an article Raskolnikov wrote titled "On Crime." Porfiry analyzes the article’s central theory: that humanity is divided into "ordinary" people (who must obey the law) and "extraordinary" people (like Napoleon, who have the right to commit crimes if it helps them achieve a great goal). Porfiry slyly asks: "If you felt you were extraordinary, would you kill and rob?" Raskolnikov calmly defends his theory.

Then, Porfiry springs a trap. He asks Raskolnikov if he saw any painters in the building when he visited the pawnbroker on the day of the murder. Raskolnikov almost slips up, but realizes just in time that there were no painters on the day of the murder—they were there days before. He evades the trap, but he knows Porfiry suspects him.

**Raskolnikov’s Mindset:**  
He is in a high-stakes duel. His intellect is firing on all cylinders, battling Porfiry’s insinuations. He feels a mixture of arrogance (defending his Superman theory) and paranoia. He knows Porfiry is playing with him like a cat with a mouse, but he cannot prove it. He leaves the meeting sweating and shaken, realizing the net is tightening.

---
### Chapter VI

Raskolnikov tries to return home but is consumed by anxiety. He fears he might have left clues. He returns to the building of the murder, ringing the bell of the old woman’s flat to relive the sensation. He asks the new workmen about the blood. He is practically daring the universe to catch him.

Later, walking on the street, a mysterious "artisan" (a stranger in a long coat) approaches him. The man looks Raskolnikov in the eye and says just one word: "Murderer." The man walks away. Raskolnikov is paralyzed with terror.

He returns to his room and falls into a feverish sleep. He dreams he is back in the pawnbroker's flat, trying to kill the old woman again. He hits her with the axe, but she doesn't die—she sits there laughing at him. The bedroom fills with people watching and laughing. He wakes up screaming.

In the doorway of his room stands a stranger. It is Arkady Ivanovitch Svidrigaïlov, the man who tormented his sister. He is standing there, smiling calmly.

**Raskolnikov’s Mindset:**  
His psychological defenses are crumbling. The encounter with the "artisan" shatters his confidence; he realizes he is not invisible. The dream reveals his deepest fear: not that he is guilty, but that he is ineffectual. The old woman laughing at him signifies that his "Napoleonic" act was a failure—he didn't conquer her; she conquered him. He wakes up feeling small, ridiculous, and trapped.

---
## PART 4
### Chapter I

Raskolnikov stares in disbelief at the man standing in his doorway. It is Svidrigaïlov, the man who ruined his sister’s reputation. To Raskolnikov’s shock, Svidrigaïlov is not aggressive but eerily calm, smiling with a smooth, socially polished veneer. He sits down uninvited. His face is described as a mask: strangely handsome, with red lips, flaxen hair, and very blue eyes, but it looks too young for his age (fifty), concealing something cold and dead.

They engage in a bizarre, disjointed conversation. Svidrigaïlov admits he is a "sinner" and a sensualist. He casually mentions that the ghost of his dead wife, Marfa Petrovna, has visited him three times, not to haunt him, but to chat about trivial things like a broken clock. He claims he has no malice toward Dounia; in fact, he wants to give her 10,000 roubles as a gift to stop her from marrying the "louse" Luzhin.

**Raskolnikov’s Mindset:**  
He is baffled and repulsed. He expects a monster, but finds a bored, cynical gentleman who claims they are "berries of the same field" (kindred spirits). Raskolnikov feels a creeping dread that Svidrigaïlov understands him on a level no one else does. He is terrified that Svidrigaïlov might use his knowledge of the "secret" against Dounia, yet he is also fascinated by the man’s nonchalant nihilism.

---
### Chapter II

Raskolnikov and Razumihin arrive at the family’s lodgings for the 8:00 PM showdown. Luzhin enters, stiff and offended, refusing to greet Raskolnikov. He sits down, pulling out a scented cambric handkerchief to demonstrate his disgust with the company. He immediately attacks, demanding an explanation for why Raskolnikov is present against his orders.

The scene explodes into a family tribunal. Dounia confronts Luzhin about his controlling behavior. Raskolnikov exposes Luzhin’s cheapness (refusing to pay for their luggage) and his philosophy that he wanted a poor wife so he could lord over her. Luzhin, cornered, loses his composure and insults the women, reminding them of their poverty. Dounia orders him to leave. Luzhin storms out, furious not at losing his bride, but at losing the "business asset" he had acquired.

**Raskolnikov’s Mindset:**  
He is cold, sharp, and triumphant. For the first time in days, he feels a surge of genuine power. He dismantles Luzhin not with an axe, but with words. However, his satisfaction is purely protective; he has saved his sister, but he knows this victory does not solve his own impending doom.

---
### Chapter III

The room is filled with relief and joy after Luzhin’s departure. Razumihin is ecstatic, making plans for a publishing business that will support them all, keeping the family together. Raskolnikov smiles and agrees, playing along with the happy fantasy.

Suddenly, Raskolnikov’s demeanor shifts. He stands up and tells his mother and sister that he must leave them. He speaks slowly, looking at them as if from a great distance. He tells them not to pursue him, that he needs to be alone to "find himself." He walks out, leaving them confused and frightened. Razumihin chases him to the stairwell, where Raskolnikov gives him a dark, silent look that conveys the truth: I am a murderer, look after them for me. Razumihin freezes, finally understanding the horror of the situation.

**Raskolnikov’s Mindset:**  
The brief moment of connection is over. He realizes that by saving Dounia, he has completed his last duty as a brother. Now, the weight of the murder crashes back down. He feels he must amputate himself from his family to avoid contaminating them. He walks into the night feeling "dead," having said goodbye to the living.

---
### Chapter IV

Raskolnikov goes straight to Sonia’s room. It is a large, irregularly shaped room that looks like a barn, with yellowish, tattered wallpaper and almost no furniture. He finds Sonia terrified and trembling. He questions her mercilessly about her life, pointing out that Katerina Ivanovna is dying, the children will be on the street, and Sonia will eventually succumb to disease or madness. He breaks down her defenses, forcing her to realize her hopelessness.

He suddenly bows down and kisses her foot. When she pulls away in shock, he declares, "I did not bow down to you, I bowed down to all the suffering of humanity." He then demands she read from the New Testament. He forces her to read the story of **The Raising of Lazarus**. Sonia reads with feverish, ecstatic energy, hoping the message of resurrection will touch his soul.

Unbeknownst to them, Svidrigaïlov is staying in the room right next door. He is sitting quietly in a chair by the locked connecting door, listening to every word.

**Raskolnikov’s Mindset:**  
He is seeking a kindred spirit in damnation. He views Sonia as a fellow "monstrosity"—someone who has destroyed her own life for a purpose. He forces her to read the Lazarus story not because he believes in God, but because he is fascinated by her faith in the face of impossible suffering. He is testing whether "resurrection" is actually possible for the dead—meaning himself.

---
### Chapter V

The next morning, Raskolnikov goes to the police station to see Porfiry Petrovitch again. He wants to officially claim his pawned watch to reduce suspicion, but really he wants to see if Porfiry knows the truth. The interview is a psychological torture chamber. Porfiry is chatty, running around the room, laughing, and talking about "psychology" and how criminals always return to the scene of the crime like moths to a candle.

Porfiry refuses to arrest him or accuse him directly. Instead, he plays a mind game, hinting that he knows everything but is waiting for Raskolnikov to confess. He talks about how a man’s "temperament" will eventually betray him. Raskolnikov becomes furious, shaking with rage, demanding that Porfiry stop playing games and arrest him if he has proof.

**Raskolnikov’s Mindset:**  
He is cracking under the pressure. Porfiry’s amorphous, shapeless accusations are more terrifying than a direct charge. Raskolnikov feels like a fly caught in a spiderweb. He is trying to use his logic to defeat Porfiry, but he realizes that Porfiry is not using logic—he is using psychological intuition. Raskolnikov feels humiliated and exposed.

---
### Chapter VI

Just as the tension in Porfiry’s office reaches a breaking point, the door bursts open. It is Mikolka (Nikolai), the house painter. He falls to his knees and screams, "I am the murderer! I am guilty!" He confesses to killing the old woman and Lizaveta.

Porfiry is visibly annoyed and flustered—this ruins his trap for Raskolnikov. Raskolnikov is stunned but realizes this is his salvation. He leaves the station quickly. On the stairs, he meets the "artisan" (the man who called him a murderer in the street earlier). The artisan apologizes, saying he saw Mikolka confess and realizes he was wrong to suspect Raskolnikov.

**Raskolnikov’s Mindset:**  
He feels a shock of "immense, animal joy." The noose that was tightening around his neck has suddenly snapped. He has been given a second chance. However, the feeling is fleeting. Deep down, he knows Porfiry didn't buy Mikolka’s confession for a second. He knows the hunt isn't over, but for now, he can breathe.

---
## PART 5
### Chapter I

Pyotr Petrovitch Luzhin wakes up in a foul mood. Staying in the apartment of his young former ward, Lebeziatnikov, Luzhin feels the sting of his breakup with Dounia keenly. He stands before the mirror, anxiously checking his noble, somewhat fatty face for jaundice, worried that his liver is reacting to his anger. He counts his money—bundles of banknotes—on the table, while Lebeziatnikov walks around the room delivering a naive, enthusiastic monologue about "communes" and the "woman question." Luzhin treats him with barely concealed contempt.

Luzhin is scheming. He is not ready to give up on Dounia, believing that poverty will eventually force her back to him. He calls for Sonia Marmeladov (who lives in the same building) to come to his room. When Sonia arrives, terrified and shy, Luzhin plays the benevolent gentleman. He suggests a plan to help her destitute stepmother, Katerina Ivanovna, by starting a subscription or lottery.

With a show of great secrecy and hesitation, he gives Sonia a ten-rouble note. However, Lebeziatnikov observes the entire interaction from the window. After Sonia leaves, Luzhin is visibly agitated, rubbing his hands together, his mind working on a dark calculation that Lebeziatnikov—blinded by his own progressive theories—completely fails to understand.

**Raskolnikov’s Mindset:**  
(Raskolnikov is absent from this chapter, but his presence is felt as the source of Luzhin’s rage. Luzhin blames Raskolnikov entirely for the broken engagement and is plotting a way to destroy him by attacking the person Raskolnikov seems to care about most: Sonia.)

---
### Chapter II

The memorial dinner for Marmeladov is a grotesque, tragic farce. Katerina Ivanovna, in the final stages of consumption (tuberculosis), has spent Raskolnikov’s twenty roubles on a spread of food and vodka she cannot afford. She is manic, coughing blood, and obsessed with proving to the "wretched" landlady and the rag-tag group of drunken lodgers that she is of noble birth. She wears her only dress and her grandmother’s green shawl.

The guests are mostly low-life drunks who only came for the free vodka. They openly mock Katerina Ivanovna. The landlady, Amalia Ivanovna, dressed in new mourning ribbons, gets into a shouting match with Katerina about her father’s rank ("My father was a Colonel!"). The scene devolves into chaos with children crying and guests laughing.

Raskolnikov arrives and sits silently, watching the disaster unfold. Katerina Ivanovna clings to him as the only "educated" guest, pouring out her complaints about the landlady. The tension explodes when the landlady insults Katerina, and Katerina tries to tear the cap off the landlady's head. Amidst the screaming and the fighting, the door opens, and Pyotr Petrovitch Luzhin appears on the threshold, looking severe and judgmental.

**Raskolnikov’s Mindset:**  
He observes the scene with "gloomy repulsion." He feels a heavy, leaden misery. The chaos of the dinner highlights the absurdity of human suffering and pride. He eats and drinks mechanically, feeling disconnected from the noise, waiting for the inevitable disaster he senses is coming.

---
### Chapter III

Luzhin refuses to sit down. He addresses the room with icy solemnity, demanding everyone listen. He accuses Sonia of stealing a 100-rouble note from his table during her visit to his room earlier that morning. Sonia denies it in terror. Luzhin demands she be searched. Katerina Ivanovna, furious at the accusation against her stepdaughter, screams that Sonia is honest and turns Sonia's pockets out herself to prove it.

A piece of paper flies out of Sonia's pocket and lands at Luzhin’s feet. It is the 100-rouble note. The room erupts. The landlady screams for the police; Sonia wails that she didn’t take it. Luzhin stands triumphant, acting the victim. But then, Lebeziatnikov steps forward. He angrily declares that he saw Luzhin secretly slip the note into Sonia's pocket while pretending to shake her hand, though he (Lebeziatnikov) originally thought it was a benevolent act done in secret.

Raskolnikov jumps in, his mind suddenly sharp. He explains Luzhin’s motive: by framing Sonia as a thief, Luzhin hoped to humiliate Raskolnikov (who is connected to her) and prove to Dounia and their mother that Raskolnikov defends a thief, thereby forcing Dounia back to Luzhin. The crowd turns on Luzhin. Someone throws a glass at him. Luzhin retreats, threatening police action, but his scheme is shattered. The landlady evicts Katerina Ivanovna and the children immediately.

**Raskolnikov’s Mindset:**  
The lethargy vanishes. Faced with a direct attack on Sonia, Raskolnikov’s protective instinct flares up. He feels a surge of intellectual clarity, easily dismantling Luzhin’s plot. However, this is followed by a darker realization: Sonia is now homeless and ruined, just like him. The tragedy binds them tighter.

---
### Chapter IV

Raskolnikov goes to Sonia’s room. She is terrified, expecting him to abandon her now that she has been disgraced. Instead, he sits down and speaks to her with a strange, dark intensity. He tells her that he has broken with his family. He asks her a hypothetical question: If she could decide who should live, Luzhin (the slanderer) or Katerina Ivanovna (the victim), who would she choose? Sonia refuses to answer such a "judge's" question.

Raskolnikov finally confesses. He does not say "I killed them." He plays a guessing game, forcing her to look at his face until she sees the truth. When she realizes it, she recoils in horror, then grabs his hands, weeping. "There is no one in the world more unhappy than you!" she cries. She does not condemn him; she embraces him.

He tries to explain why he did it—not for money, but to see if he was a "Napoleon" or a "louse." To see if he had the power to step over moral lines. He admits, "I killed myself, not the old woman." Sonia tells him he must go to the crossroads, kiss the earth he has defiled, and confess aloud to the world. Raskolnikov refuses to go to prison yet, but he accepts the cross she offers him.

**Raskolnikov’s Mindset:**  
He has reached the breaking point. He confesses not to seek forgiveness (he still despises his own weakness), but because he can no longer bear the isolation. He needs a human soul to share the burden. When Sonia responds with love instead of revulsion, he is shaken. He realizes his theory was wrong—human life cannot be calculated or dismissed. He is overwhelmed by her suffering and her strength.

---
### Chapter V

Lebeziatnikov knocks on Sonia's door. He is out of breath. He reports that Katerina Ivanovna has gone mad. She has taken the three children into the streets, dressed in ridiculous costumes (turban, ostrich feather), and is making them sing and dance for money, beating them when they cry.

Raskolnikov and Sonia rush to the street. They find Katerina Ivanovna near the canal, singing hoarsely, coughing blood, and screaming at the crowd. She refuses to go back to the lodging. She runs from a policeman and falls, hemorrhaging blood from her throat. They carry her back to Sonia's room.

Katerina Ivanovna dies in Sonia's bed, refusing a priest ("I have no sins!"). As she dies, Svidrigaïlov appears in the doorway. He approaches Raskolnikov and calmly states that he will use the 10,000 roubles (intended for Dounia) to place the children in orphanages and provide for them. He then whispers to Raskolnikov: "I heard everything. I live right next door."

**Raskolnikov’s Mindset:**  
He watches the death of Katerina Ivanovna with a sense of inevitability. The tragedy seems complete. But Svidrigaïlov’s revelation hits him like a hammer blow. Just as he thought he had found a confidant in Sonia, he learns that his "dark mirror" (Svidrigaïlov) knows his secret, too. He is trapped. The realization that Svidrigaïlov was listening through the wall destroys his momentary sense of relief.

---
## PART 6
### Chapter I
**The Action:**  
A strange, foggy period begins for Raskolnikov. He wanders in a dreary solitude, his memory fragmented. He spends days in apathy, roaming the countryside or sleeping in the bushes, followed by moments of panic. He attends Katerina Ivanovna’s funeral, which is a tragic, chaotic affair. He learns from Razumihin that his mother has fallen ill and that Dounia has received a mysterious letter that upset her greatly.

Razumihin, now effectively the caretaker of the Raskolnikov family, confronts Raskolnikov in the corridor of their building. He is angry and confused by Raskolnikov’s behavior but remains loyal. Raskolnikov feels a heavy, leaden misery. He is particularly worried about Svidrigaïlov—he knows the man is up to something, but he cannot pin him down.

**Raskolnikov’s Mindset:**  
He is drifting toward the end. The "game" is essentially over, and he knows it, yet he still lacks the resolve to finish it. He feels a vague, objectless anxiety about the immediate future (police/Svidrigaïlov) but a much deeper, more vital anxiety about his own soul. He is morally fatigued.

---
### Chapter II

**The Action:**  
Raskolnikov goes to the police station to see Porfiry Petrovitch, expecting the worst. He enters Porfiry’s office, ready for battle. But this time, the atmosphere is different. Porfiry is not playing games; he is not giggling or running around. He is solemn, polite, and direct. He offers Raskolnikov a cigarette and sits him down.

Porfiry drops the mask. He tells Raskolnikov plainly: "I know you did it." He explains why the house painter, Mikolka, confessed—it was a religious delusion, a desire to "suffer" for his sins, characteristic of certain Russian sects (the Raskolniks/Old Believers). Porfiry dismisses Mikolka’s confession as fantastic and psychologically impossible.

He tells Raskolnikov that he has enough evidence to arrest him but wants him to surrender voluntarily to mitigate the sentence. He gives Raskolnikov a deadline: "I can let you walk about for another day or two."

**Raskolnikov’s Mindset:**  
The uncertainty is finally gone. There is no more cat-and-mouse; the cat has spoken. Paradoxically, Raskolnikov feels a flash of defiance. He refuses to admit guilt to Porfiry, maintaining his mask of innocence even as Porfiry lays out the facts. He leaves the station not broken, but with a strange, new resolve to solve the Svidrigaïlov problem before he submits.

---
### Chapter III

**The Action:**  
Raskolnikov tracks Svidrigaïlov to a dirty, third-rate tavern/eating-house on the X—— Prospect. Svidrigaïlov is sitting by an open window, drinking tea and pipe-smoking. He tries to hide when he sees Raskolnikov, but Raskolnikov confronts him. They sit together. Svidrigaïlov orders champagne and talks loosely.

Svidrigaïlov is in a strange mood—cynical, bored, yet sharp. He tells stories of his past (how he was a card sharp, how his wife bought him out of prison). He discusses his upcoming marriage to a sixteen-year-old girl, which he treats as a lecherous joke. Raskolnikov threatens him: if Svidrigaïlov tries to use his knowledge of the murder to blackmail Dounia, Raskolnikov will kill him. Svidrigaïlov laughs it off but reveals he has arranged a meeting with Dounia.

**Raskolnikov’s Mindset:**  
He looks at Svidrigaïlov with "intense disgust." He sees Svidrigaïlov not just as an enemy, but as a mirror of what happens when one steps over the line of morality without a conscience—hollow, bored depravity. Raskolnikov is desperate to protect his sister from this monster, fearing that Svidrigaïlov’s knowledge of the murder gives him unlimited power over her.

---
### Chapter IV

**The Action:**  
Raskolnikov tries to follow Svidrigaïlov after they leave the tavern, but Svidrigaïlov manages to lose him by hopping into a carriage. Svidrigaïlov then proceeds to execute his plan. He has lured Dounia to his apartment with a letter promising to reveal the "secret" of her brother.

Dounia arrives at Svidrigaïlov’s lodgings. He meets her on the street and leads her up to his rooms. He shows her the empty apartment next to his own—the very room where he sat listening through the wall while Raskolnikov confessed to Sonia. He tells Dounia the truth: her brother is a murderer.

**Raskolnikov’s Mindset:**  
(Raskolnikov is absent from this scene, but his fate hangs in the balance. This chapter focuses on Svidrigaïlov’s final gambit.)

---
### Chapter V

**The Action:**  
The confrontation between Dounia and Svidrigaïlov. Svidrigaïlov offers Dounia a deal: he will save her brother (get him a passport, send him abroad) if she gives herself to him. He locks the door, trapping her. Dounia realizes he is serious. She pulls out a revolver (one she stole from Marfa Petrovna) and aims it at him.

Svidrigaïlov is thrilled by her fierceness. He steps toward her. She fires—the bullet grazes his temple, drawing blood. He stops, folds his arms, and tells her to reload and fire again. She raises the gun but cannot pull the trigger a second time; she throws the gun away. Svidrigaïlov approaches her and asks, "You don't love me?" She whispers, "Never."

A terrible change comes over Svidrigaïlov. He realizes he can never force her to love him. He unlocks the door and tells her to go. She flees. He remains alone, picking up the revolver she left behind.

**Svidrigaïlov’s Mindset:**  
This is the breaking point for the nihilist. Svidrigaïlov has lived a life of pure self-gratification, believing nothing matters. But he genuinely wanted Dounia. Her absolute rejection—even when he held her brother’s life in his hands—shatters him. He realizes his money and power cannot buy the one thing that might have redeemed him.

---
### Chapter VI

**The Action:**  
Svidrigaïlov spends his final night settling his affairs. He visits Sonia and gives her 3,000 roubles so she can follow Raskolnikov to Siberia. He visits the parents of his young fiancée and leaves them 15,000 roubles.

A storm rages over St. Petersburg. Soaking wet, Svidrigaïlov checks into a dirty, remote hotel. He has terrifying nightmares: a flood, a coffin containing a girl who drowned herself because of him, and finally, a hallucination of a five-year-old girl whose face turns into the leering face of a French harlot.

At dawn, he walks out into the thick, milky mist. He approaches a watchtower where a soldier in a large copper Achilles helmet is standing guard. Svidrigaïlov jokes with the soldier ("I am going to America"). He puts the revolver to his right temple and pulls the trigger.

**Svidrigaïlov’s Mindset:**  
Total spiritual exhaustion. The nightmares reveal the rot inside his soul—he cannot escape the corruption he has caused. He chooses suicide ("America") because he has exhausted all of life's pleasures and found nothing but boredom and horror. He is the foil to Raskolnikov: the man who stepped over the line and found he could not live with the emptiness on the other side.

---
### Chapter VII

**The Action:**  
It is evening of the same day. Raskolnikov visits his mother for the last time. He does not confess to her, but he speaks in a way that makes it clear he is going away forever. He asks her to pray for him. Pulcheria cries; she suspects the truth but refuses to admit it to herself.

He returns to his room and finds Dounia waiting. She knows everything (from Svidrigaïlov). Raskolnikov tells her he is going to give himself up. He is still proud, though—he refuses to admit that what he did was a "crime" in the moral sense. He calls the pawnbroker a "louse" and regrets only his own weakness in failing to carry the burden. He leaves her, telling her not to follow him.

**Raskolnikov’s Mindset:**  
He is bitter. He is surrendering not because he repents, but because he is "weak." He feels he has failed his own theory. He tells Dounia, "I am going to give myself up... but I don't know why." He is still fighting his conscience, viewing his surrender as a capitulation to stupidity rather than a moral awakening.

---
### Chapter VIII

**The Action:**  
Raskolnikov goes to Sonia’s room. He asks for a cross. She gives him a cypress wood cross (for the common people). He tells her he is going. She puts on her green shawl to follow him, but he tells her to stay back.

He walks to the Hay Market (the crossroads). Recalling Sonia’s command, he kneels down in the middle of the filthy square, amidst the laughter of drunkards, and kisses the earth. He tries to say "I am a murderer," but the words choke him. A stranger shouts, "He’s going to Jerusalem, lads! He’s saying goodbye to his country!"

He proceeds to the police station. He learns from the explosive lieutenant, Ilya Petrovitch, that Svidrigaïlov has shot himself. This news stuns Raskolnikov; he walks out of the station, his resolve failing. But then he sees Sonia standing in the courtyard, pale and terrified, watching him. Her presence gives him the strength to go back.

He re-enters the office and says softly: "It was I killed the old pawnbroker woman and her sister Lizaveta with an axe and robbed them."

**Raskolnikov’s Mindset:**  
The kiss of the earth is the first true step toward redemption—reconnecting with the soil and the people. However, his pride almost stops him at the last second when he hears about Svidrigaïlov (who took the "other" way out: suicide). Seeing Sonia breaks his pride. He realizes he cannot leave her alone; he must go through the ordeal of prison to eventually be with her. The confession is the death of his theory and the birth of his suffering.

---

## Eplilogue

In Siberia, one and a half years have passed since the crime. Raskolnikov is now a second-class convict in a fortress prison on the banks of a vast, solitary river. The narrative recaps the trial: Raskolnikov confessed to everything with brutal, mechanical exactness. He described the "pledge" (the wood and iron fake cigarette case), the purse he never opened, and the stone under which he hid the loot. The judges were baffled by the fact that he never counted the money; this, combined with the testimony of his poverty and past good deeds (rescuing children from a fire, supporting a consumptive student), led them to conclude he was suffering from temporary insanity. He was sentenced to only eight years of hard labor.

Back in St. Petersburg, Pulcheria Alexandrovna fell into a strange, delirious illness. She refused to accept the truth, convincing herself that her son was away on a secret, important mission for the government. She eventually died of brain fever two weeks after the trial, never explicitly being told the truth, though in her delirium, she revealed she likely knew everything. Dounia and Razumihin married two months after the trial and plan to move to Siberia in five years.

Sonia moved to the prison town immediately. She writes monthly letters to Dounia and Razumihin. Her reports are dry and factual: Raskolnikov is sullen, unsociable, and indifferent to his physical hardships (the bad food, the shaved head, the fetters). He ignores Sonia during her visits, treating her coldly, though he becomes anxious when she is ill and cannot come. He lives in a state of suspended animation, shut off from the world.

Raskolnikov falls ill, not from the hard labor, but from wounded pride. Lying in the prison hospital during the weeks of Lent and Easter, he has a terrifying, feverish dream that acts as the philosophical climax of the book.  
The Dream of the Plague: He dreams that a new, microscopic trichinae has drifted from Asia into Europe. These microbes are spirits endowed with intelligence and will. People infected by them instantly believe that they alone possess the absolute truth. No one can agree on what is good or evil. Men kill each other in senseless rage, armies fight against themselves, and the world collapses into chaos because everyone believes they are the "extraordinary man." Only a few pure souls are destined to survive, but no one can hear their voices.

After recovering, Raskolnikov returns to work. One warm, bright spring morning, he is sent to a shed on the riverbank to pound alabaster. The guard turns away. Raskolnikov sits on a pile of logs, gazing across the wide, deserted river at the infinite steppes where nomadic tribes live—a place where time seems to have stood still since the age of Abraham. It is the antithesis of the cramped, suffocating St. Petersburg.

Sonia appears and sits beside him. She offers her hand timidly. Suddenly, something breaks inside him. He weeps and throws himself at her feet, hugging her knees. She is terrified at first, but then she sees the light in his eyes and understands: he loves her. The barrier of pride has finally shattered. He resolves to wait out the remaining seven years. That evening, under his pillow, he finds the New Testament she gave him. He does not open it yet, but the thought crosses his mind: "Can her convictions not be mine now?"
