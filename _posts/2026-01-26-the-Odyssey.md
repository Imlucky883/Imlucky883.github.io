- **The Divine Council:** While Poseidon is away visiting the Ethiopians, Athena appeals to Zeus on behalf of Odysseus, who has been trapped for seven years on Ogygia by the nymph Calypso.
    
- **Zeus's Reflection:** Zeus muses on human folly, citing Aegisthus—who ignored divine warnings, murdered Agamemnon, and was subsequently killed by Agamemnon's son, Orestes.
    
- **The Plan:** Zeus agrees to allow Odysseus to return. Hermes is to be sent to Calypso to demand Odysseus’s release, while Athena goes to Ithaca.
    
- **Athena in Ithaca:** Disguised as Mentes (a family friend), Athena finds Odysseus’s house overrun by arrogant suitors who are consuming his wealth and courting his wife, Penelope.
    
- **Inspiring Telemachus:** Athena speaks to Odysseus’s son, Telemachus. She gives him hope that his father is alive and tells him he must grow up and act. She instructs him to call an assembly of the Ithacans and then travel to Pylos and Sparta for news.
    
- **Penelope’s Grief:** Penelope enters the hall and asks the bard Phemius to stop singing of the Greeks' difficult returns from Troy because it causes her too much pain.

- **Confronting the Suitors:** Telemachus tells the suitors they must leave his house. The lead suitors, Antinous and Eurymachus, respond with mockery and question the identity of his "visitor."

### **Book 2: A Dangerous Journey**

- **The Assembly:** For the first time since Odysseus left 20 years ago, Telemachus calls a formal assembly of the Ithacan elders.
    
- **The Complaint:** Telemachus tearfully denounces the suitors for destroying his estate.
    
- **Antinous’s Counter-Argument:** Antinous blames Penelope for the delay, revealing her trick: she claimed she would marry once she finished a shroud for Laertes (Odysseus’s father), but she spent three years weaving it by day and unweaving it by night.
    
- **The Omen:** Zeus sends two eagles that fight above the assembly. The prophet Halitherses interprets this as a sign that Odysseus is near and the suitors face a bloody end.
    
- **Eurymachus’s Defiance:** Eurymachus mocks the prophecy and insists that Telemachus must send his mother back to her father, Icarius, to arrange a new marriage.
    
- **Telemachus’s Request:** Realizing the assembly will not act, Telemachus asks for a ship and a crew of twenty.
    
- **Mentor and Leocritus:** Mentor (an old friend of Odysseus) scolds the people for their passivity. The suitor Leocritus shuts down the meeting, claiming Telemachus will never actually make the trip.
    
- **Divine Aid:** Athena reappears to Telemachus, this time disguised as Mentor. She encourages him, finds a ship (borrowed from a man named Noëmon), and recruits a crew of volunteers.
    
- **Secret Preparation:** Telemachus tells only Eurycleia of his plans, making her swear an oath not to tell Penelope for twelve days.

- **Nestor’s Hospitality:** Nestor welcomes the strangers warmly before even asking their names, upholding the laws of xenia (hospitality).

- **Missing News:** Nestor has no definitive news of Odysseus’s fate after they parted ways at Tenedos, but he praises Odysseus’s legendary cunning and notes how much Telemachus resembles him in speech.
    
- **The Agamemnon Parallel:** Nestor retells the story of Orestes’s revenge on Aegisthus, explicitly holding it up as a model of how Telemachus should defend his own father's honor.
    
- **Athena’s Revelation:** As night falls, "Mentor" declines an invitation to stay in the palace and instead transforms into an "ossifrage" (a sea-vulture) and flies away. Nestor realizes he has been hosting a goddess and vows to sacrifice a gold-horned heifer to her.

- **Helen’s Entrance:** Helen enters and immediately recognizes Telemachus by his striking resemblance to his father.
    
- **Drugs and Stories:** As the group weeps for Odysseus, Helen mixes a drug from Egypt into the wine to take away all pain and grief. She tells a story of Odysseus infiltrating Troy disguised as a beggar; Menelaus counters with the story of Odysseus’s discipline inside the Wooden Horse.

- **The Game and the Waking:** After finishing the laundry and bathing, the girls play a game of ball. Their shouting wakes Odysseus, who emerges from the bushes naked, covering himself with only a leafy branch.
    
- **Calculated Flattery:** While the other girls flee in terror, Nausicaa stands her ground. Odysseus uses his "metis" (cunning) to deliver a highly persuasive speech, comparing her to a goddess and a "fresh young palm tree" rather than touching her knees in supplication (which might have frightened her).
    
- **Nausicaa’s Xenia:** Nausicaa recognizes Odysseus as a man of status who has fallen on hard times. She provides him with clothes and food and tells her slaves that "all foreigners and beggars come from Zeus."

### **Book 7: A Magical Kingdom**

- **Divine Suspicions:** Alcinous wonders if Odysseus is a god in disguise. Odysseus reassures him that he is purely mortal and "a match for any man" in suffering.
    
- **Arete’s Questioning:** Noticing Odysseus is wearing the clothes she wove for her daughter, Arete asks him directly who he is and who gave him his garments.
    
- **The Seven Years on Ogygia:** Odysseus tells the story of his shipwreck and his seven years with Calypso, his departure, the storm, and his meeting with Nausicaa at the river. He protects Nausicaa by claiming it was his idea not to enter the city with her.

- **The Insult:** Alcinous’s son, Laodamas, invites Odysseus to compete. When Odysseus declines, the athlete Euryalus insults him, calling him a mere "merchant" who cares only for "ill-gotten gains."
    
- **The Discus Throw:** Enraged, Odysseus makes a speech about how the gods distribute gifts differently (some get looks, others get eloquence). He seizes a massive discus and hurls it far beyond all the Phaeacians' marks.
    
- **A Friend in Disguise:** Athena, disguised as a spectator, marks the spot and declares that no one can beat him. Odysseus then challenges the Phaeacians to any sport except the footrace (noting his legs are weak from the sea).
    
- **Song of Ares and Aphrodite:** To soothe the tension, Alcinous calls for dancing and another song. Demodocus sings the humorous tale of Hephaestus trapping Ares and Aphrodite in a web of invisible chains while they were in bed.

- **The Lotus-Eaters:** A storm drives them to the land of the Lotus-Eaters. Three men eat the honey-sweet fruit, which makes them lose all desire to return home. Odysseus must drag them back to the ships and tie them up.
    
- **Arrival at the Cyclopes' Island:** They reach a fertile, lawless land inhabited by the one-eyed giants. Odysseus describes the island with a colonizer’s eye, noting its untapped resources.

- **Blinding the Giant:** While Polyphemus sleeps, Odysseus and his men sharpen an olive-wood stake and drive it into the giant's single eye. When Polyphemus screams for help, his neighbors ask who is hurting him; he replies, "Noman is killing me!" and they leave.
    
- **The Escape:** Odysseus ties his remaining men to the bellies of the giant’s rams. Polyphemus feels the backs of the sheep as they exit the next morning but misses the men underneath.
    
- **The Fatal Hubris:** Once safely on his ship, Odysseus cannot resist taunting the giant. He shouts his real name and home. Polyphemus, revealed as a son of Poseidon, prays to his father to ensure Odysseus never reaches home—or arrives late, alone, and to a "house of trouble."
    

### **Book 10: The Winds and the Witch**

- **Aeolus and the Bag of Winds:** They reach the floating island of Aeolus, king of the winds. He gifts Odysseus a bag containing all the storm winds so only the favorable West Wind will blow them home.
    
- **The Folly of the Crew:** They get within sight of Ithaca’s shores. While Odysseus sleeps, the crew, thinking the bag contains gold, opens it. The resulting gale blasts them all the way back to Aeolus.
    
- **The Rejection:** Aeolus refuses to help a second time, believing Odysseus must be cursed by the gods.
    
- **The Laestrygonians:** They reach Telepylus, home of cannibal giants. The giants pelt the fleet with boulders. Only Odysseus’s ship escapes; the other eleven ships are destroyed, and their crews are eaten.

- **The War Heroes:** Odysseus meets Agamemnon, who recounts his murder by Clytemnestra and warns Odysseus to never trust women—even Penelope—fully. He then meets Achilles, who famously tells him he would rather be a living farmhand than king of all the dead.
    
- **The Silent Ajax:** The ghost of Ajax refuses to speak to Odysseus, still harboring a grudge because Odysseus won the armor of Achilles in a contest.
    
- **The Sufferers:** Odysseus witnesses the eternal punishments of Tityus, Tantalus, and Sisyphus.

- **Eumaeus’s Kindness:** Though he doesn't believe the news about Odysseus, Eumaeus continues to treat the guest with honor, preparing a prime hog for their dinner.

- **Loyalty in the Cold:** Odysseus sleeps in the hut, but Eumaeus, ever the "noble slave," goes outside to sleep with his pigs in the wind and rain to protect his master's property.
    

### **Book 15: The Prince Returns**

- **Athena in Sparta:** Athena visits Telemachus at Menelaus's palace. She warns him to return home immediately because Penelope’s father is pressuring her to marry the suitor Eurymachus. She also warns him of the suitors' ambush in the strait.
    
- **Parting Gifts:** Menelaus gives Telemachus a silver bowl, and Helen gives him a beautiful robe she wove herself, intended for his future bride.

- **Eumaeus’s Backstory:** Eumaeus reveals he was born a prince of the island Syria. He was kidnapped as a child by a Phoenician slave girl and sold to Laertes. He was raised in the household almost as a brother to Odysseus's sister, Ctimene.

### **Book 16: Father and Son**

- **The Arrival:** Telemachus reaches Eumaeus's hut. The dogs do not bark at him, which tells the "beggar" that a friend has arrived. Eumaeus greets Telemachus with the emotion of a father for a long-lost son.

- **The Reunion:** Telemachus is terrified, thinking the stranger is a god. Odysseus identifies himself, and the two embrace, weeping loudly.
    
- **Counting the Enemy:** Odysseus and Telemachus begin planning. Telemachus lists the suitors: 108 in total, including their henchmen. He doubts two men can beat so many, but Odysseus reminds him they have Athena and Zeus on their side.
    
- **The Strategic Plan:** Odysseus tells Telemachus to return to the hall. Later, the "beggar" will arrive with Eumaeus. On a signal from Odysseus, Telemachus must hide all the weapons and armor in the hall so the suitors are defenseless.

### **Book 17: Insults and Abuse**

- **The Journey to Town:** Odysseus and Eumaeus begin their walk to the city. On the way, they encounter the goatherd Melanthius, who represents the disloyal servants. He mocks the "beggar" and kicks him, but Odysseus restrains his urge to retaliate.
    
- **Argos:** Outside the palace, Odysseus sees his old dog, Argos, who has been neglected and left on a dung heap. The dog recognizes his master's voice, wags his tail, and dies—having waited twenty years to see him one last time.
    
- **Entering the Hall:** Odysseus enters his own home as a beggar, asking the suitors for scraps to test their character. Most give him food, but Antinous is particularly hostile.

- **Penelope’s Interest:** Hearing of the beggar's mistreatment, Penelope is outraged. She asks Eumaeus to bring the stranger to her so she can ask if he has news of her husband. Odysseus delays the meeting until nightfall to avoid further conflict with the suitors.
    

### **Book 18: Two Beggars**

- **The Rivalry:** Irus, a common town beggar known for his greed, arrives and tries to bully Odysseus out of the palace doorway. The suitors, led by Antinous, egg them on and organize a fight for the entertainment of the hall.
    
- **The Fight:** Odysseus reveals his powerful physique (enhanced by Athena). Terrified, Irus tries to back out, but the suitors force him to fight. Odysseus lands a single blow that breaks Irus's jaw, then drags him outside.
    
- **Warning to Amphinomus:** One suitor, Amphinomus, treats Odysseus kindly after the fight. Odysseus, feeling a moment of pity, warns him to leave the palace before the master returns to seek blood. However, Athena has already fated Amphinomus to die by Telemachus's spear.
    
- **Penelope’s Appearance:** Athena inspires Penelope to show herself to the suitors to "open their hearts." The goddess enhances her beauty with divine grace.

- **Penelope’s Test:** Penelope, suspicious of his story, asks for a description of Odysseus’s clothing. The "beggar" describes a specific purple cloak and a golden brooch featuring a dog and a fawn—items Penelope knows well. She is overcome with tears.
    
- **The Secret Recognition:** Penelope orders Eurycleia to wash the guest’s feet. While doing so, the old nurse recognizes a scar on his leg from a childhood boar hunt. She drops his foot into the basin in shock, but Odysseus grabs her by the throat and swears her to silence.
    
- **The Dream of the Geese:** Penelope, unaware of the recognition, describes a dream where an eagle kills twenty of her pet geese. The "beggar" interprets it as the return of her husband to kill the suitors.
    
- **The Archery Contest:** Penelope remains skeptical and decides that the time has come to choose a husband. She announces she will hold a contest the next day: she will marry whoever can string Odysseus's great bow and shoot an arrow through twelve axe-heads. Odysseus encourages her to set the contest immediately.
    

### **Book 20: The Last Banquet**

- **Odysseus’s Anger:** Odysseus lies awake on the porch, watching the disloyal maidservants sneak out to sleep with the suitors. His "heart barks" with rage, but he reminds himself to be patient, recalling his endurance in the Cyclops's cave.
    
- **Divine and Mortal Prayers:** Athena appears and reassures Odysseus that he will succeed. Penelope, meanwhile, prays to Artemis to end her life rather than force her to remarry.

- **The Ox-Foot:** Athena goads the suitors into further insolence to sharpen Odysseus's rage. Ctesippus, a wealthy and lawless suitor, hurls a cow’s foot at Odysseus. Odysseus ducks, and Telemachus threatens to kill Ctesippus if he ever tries such a thing again.
    
- **The Vision of Death:** Athena strikes the suitors with a "mad laughter." They begin to hallucinate; their meat appears bloody, and the walls seem to drip with gore.

### **Book 21: An Archery Contest**

- **The History of the Bow:** Penelope goes to the inner storeroom to retrieve Odysseus’s great bow. The poet explains its history: it was a gift from Iphitus, who was later murdered by Heracles. Odysseus never took it to Troy, leaving it at home as a memento.
    
- **The Muscular Hand:** In a detail emphasized by Wilson’s translation, Penelope’s "muscular, firm hand" uses the bronze key to open the storeroom. She retrieves the bow and weeps over it.

- **The Suitors Fail:** The suitors try one by one. Leodes, their "holy man," fails first and predicts the bow will bring death to many. Antinous has Melanthius grease the bow with fat to make it supple, but even the strongest suitors cannot bend it.
    
- **The Loyal Servants Recruited:** Outside the hall, Odysseus reveals his true identity to Eumaeus (the swineherd) and Philoetius (the cowherd) by showing them his scar. They weep with joy, and he gives them their orders for the coming slaughter.

- **Penelope and Telemachus Intervene:** Penelope insists the guest be allowed to try, promising him gifts but not marriage. Telemachus then asserts his "power in this house," scolds his mother, and sends her upstairs to her loom.
    
- **The Climax:** Eumaeus brings the bow to Odysseus while Eurycleia locks the doors to the women’s quarters and Philoetius bolts the outer gates. Odysseus examines the bow like a "musician," strings it effortlessly, and shoots the arrow perfectly through all twelve axes. Zeus thunders in approval.

- **The Treachery of Melanthius:** The goatherd Melanthius sneaks into the storeroom (which Telemachus left ajar) and brings twelve sets of armor to the suitors. On his second trip, Eumaeus and Philoetius catch him, tie him up, and hoist him to the rafters to suffer.
    
- **Athena’s Test:** Athena appears as Mentor. Odysseus begs for her help. To test Odysseus’s courage, she first lets the suitors hurl spears at him, which she deflects. Only after Odysseus proves his martial worth does she raise her "deadly aegis" (shield/protection), causing the suitors to panic.
    
- **The Slaughter:** The four men attack the suitors like "vultures" attacking smaller birds. The floor runs with blood.

- **The Silent Reunion:** Penelope goes downstairs. She sits across from Odysseus in silence, torn between recognition and suspicion. Telemachus calls her "cruel" and "hard-hearted" for her hesitation.
    
- **The Fake Wedding:** To prevent the suitors’ families from discovering the massacre too soon, Odysseus orders the bard to play a loud dance tune so neighbors will think Penelope has finally chosen a husband and is celebrating a wedding.
    
- **The Ultimate Test:** Odysseus bathes and is enhanced by Athena. He calls Penelope an "extraordinary woman" with a heart "harder than rock." He asks the nurse to make up a bed for him. Penelope tells Eurycleia to move his "firmly built" bed outside the bedroom.
    
- **The Reveal:** Odysseus becomes enraged, explaining the secret of the bed: he built the palace around a living olive tree and hand-carved the bedpost from its trunk. It is unmovable. This "token" is the final proof Penelope needs.
    
- **The Embrace:** Penelope finally accepts him, explaining that she had to be cautious to avoid being tricked by "some bad man." They weep in each other’s arms.

- **Testing Laertes:** Odysseus finds his father, Laertes, working alone in an orchard, looking ragged and miserable. Odysseus initially maintains his disguise, telling another "Cretan" lie to see if his father is still loyal.
    
- **The Father's Grief:** When Laertes begins to sob at the mention of his son, Odysseus can no longer endure it. He reveals himself. Laertes asks for a sign, and Odysseus shows him the scar and correctly names the fruit trees Laertes gave him when he was a boy. They embrace.
